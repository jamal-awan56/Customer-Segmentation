# ðŸ§  Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

This project applies K-Means Clustering, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, to perform customer segmentation based on behavioral data. The objective is to identify distinct customer groups to help businesses tailor marketing strategies and improve customer retention.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Objective

To group customers into segments based on common traits such as age, income, and spending score using clustering techniques. This segmentation can help companies:
- Personalize marketing campaigns
- Identify high-value customers
- Design better product offerings

---

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

The project uses a Mall Customer Dataset (or similar), which includes the following features:
- `CustomerID`
- `Gender`
- `Age`
- `Annual Income (k$)`
- `Spending Score (1â€“100)`

---

## ðŸš€ Project Workflow

1. Data Preprocessing
   - Handling missing values
   - Feature selection
   - Encoding categorical variables if required

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   - Distribution of age, gender, income, and spending score
   - Pairplots and correlation analysis
   - Visualizing customer patterns

3. Feature Scaling
   - Normalization using `StandardScaler`

4. Optimal Cluster Selection
   - Elbow Method to determine the ideal number of clusters

5. Model Training
   - KMeans clustering using scikit-learn
   - Assigning cluster labels to each customer

6. Cluster Visualization
   - 2D/3D plots to visualize customer segments
   - Colored cluster plots with income vs. spending behavior

## ðŸ§  Key Learnings

- How unsupervised learning works for pattern discovery
- Importance of feature scaling in distance-based models
- Using the Elbow Method for optimal cluster selection
- Gaining business insights from data patterns

---

## ðŸ“š Libraries Used

- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Pandas & NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Outputs

- Identified 3â€“5 meaningful customer segments
- Visualized spending vs. income for different clusters
- Gained actionable insights for customer-centric strategies
